#### Effective Date: February 01, 2021

## Introduction
The scrum team members are expected to act with great professionalism and carry themselves well with good etiquette while performing their duties and interacting with individuals on a daily basis. This code of conduct outlines the ethics that are required of each team member.

### 1.	Punctuality and Attendance
Members of the scrum team are expected to attend and be on time for daily stand-up. In cases where a team member is unable to make the daily stand-up because of any personal issues, the team member must inform the scrum master beforehand, and they will be exempted from any disciplinary action.

### 2.	Mistreatment
Any mistreatment is strictly prohibited. Scrum team members must respect their team as well as other individuals (clients, customers, and the public) regardless of their age, gender, race or creed. Always be courteous to others and welcome new ideas from everyone especially from team members.

### 3.	Accountability
Scrum team members are expected to be responsible for their actions. Team members should take full responsibility for the tasks that they are assigned and realize that their results will always aid the entire team. Team members must not blame others for their results. Instead, they should show accountability by attending and being on time for daily stand-up, completing assigned tasks before the deadline and by showing appreciation and support towards the team when needed.

### 4.	Integrity
Members of the scrum team should always be honest in everything they do, regardless of the situation at hand. Members are expected to do what is right and adhere to the ethical principles defined in the code of conduct.

### 5.	Strive for Excellence
Members should always aim for excellence. We should always look at the situation at hand and figure out ways we can further improve it. Mistakes are inevitable, so we must not stop when things are going wrong, instead, we should value the situation at hand and learn from it in order to get a better result next time.
